#' The GMPE of Zea 2016 for shallow crustal or upper mantle event
#'
#' This function calculates the ground motion median values and standard deviations
#' @param mag Moment magnitude, a numeric value
#' @param T Period (sec) (range should be between 0.005 s and 5 s).
#' Use 1000 (by default) for output the array of Sa with original Zhao et al per-defined periods
#' @param fDepth Depth(km) to the top of ruptured plane (km)
#' @param dist The closest distance (km) to rupture plane when is available,
#' otherwise hypocentral distance.
#' @param DistV The distance of volcanic path (km)
#' @param eqkType The indicator of earthquake type: 1-shallow crustal; 2-upper mantel;
#' only two values are valid
#' @param FaultMech The indicator of fault mechanism: 1-Reverse; 2-Strike Slip; 3-Normal
#' @param SiteClass The site class: 1 for SC I, 2 for SC II, 3 for SC III 4 for SC IV sites. The relationship
#' between site class and Vs30 is given by Zhao et al., 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1785/0120150056).
#' SC I: Vs30 > 600 m/s; SC II: 300 < Vs30 =< 600 m/s; SC III: 200 < Vs30 =< 300 m/s; SC IV: Vs30 <= 200 m/s
#' @return A list of six elements is returned: Sa - median spectral acceleration prediction (in g);
#' RockSa - median spectral acceleration prediction on Rock reference site (in g);
#' SiteAmp - Site amplication response spectral (subtraction in log(g)); sigma - totla standard deviation (log);
#' phiSS - single station standard deviation (log); period - the corresponding oscillator periods

#'
#' This function calculates the ground motion median values and standard deviations
#' @param mag Moment magnitude, a numeric value
#' @param T Period (sec) (range should be between 0.005 s and 5 s).
#' Use 1000 (by default) for output the array of Sa with original Zhao et al per-defined periods
#' @param fDepth Depth(km) to the top of ruptured plane (km)
#' @param dist The closest distance (km) to rupture plane when is available,
#' otherwise hypocentral distance.
#' @param DistV The distance of volcanic path (km)
#' @param SiteClass The site class: 1 for SC I, 2 for SC II, 3 for SC III 4 for SC IV sites. The relationship
#' between site class and Vs30 is given by Zhao et al., 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1785/0120150056).
#' SC I: Vs30 > 600 m/s; SC II: 300 < Vs30 =< 600 m/s; SC III: 200 < Vs30 =< 300 m/s; SC IV: Vs30 <= 200 m/s
#' @return A list of six elements is returned: Sa - median spectral acceleration prediction (in g);
#' RockSa - median spectral acceleration prediction on Rock reference site (in g);
#' SiteAmp - Site amplication response spectral (subtraction in log(g)); sigma - totla standard deviation;

#'
#' This function calculates the ground motion median values and standard deviations
#' @param mag Moment magnitude, a numeric value
#' @param T Period (sec) (range should be between 0.005 s and 5 s).
#' Use 1000 (by default) for output the array of Sa with original Zhao et al per-defined periods
#' @param fDepth Depth(km) to the top of ruptured plane (km)
#' @param dist The closest distance (km) to rupture plane when is available,
#' otherwise hypocentral distance.
#' @param DistV The distance of volcanic path (km)
#' @param SiteClass The site class: 1 for SC I, 2 for SC II, 3 for SC III 4 for SC IV sites. The relationship
#' between site class and Vs30 is given by Zhao et al., 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1785/0120150056).
#' SC I: Vs30 > 600 m/s; SC II: 300 < Vs30 =< 600 m/s; SC III: 200 < Vs30 =< 300 m/s; SC IV: Vs30 <= 200 m/s
#' @return A list of six elements is returned: Sa - median spectral acceleration prediction (in g);
#' RockSa - median spectral acceleration prediction on Rock reference site (in g);
#' SiteAmp - Site amplication response spectral (subtraction in log(g)); sigma - totla standard deviation;
