The pacakge is developed for research use. This package contains
commonly used Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). It includes
five NGA-West2 Models (ASK14, BSSA14, CB14, CY14, and I14) for crustal
earthquakes; and four (BC Hyrdo 2011 + 2018, Zhao et al 2016, Parker et
al 2020 NGA-Subduction) for subduction earthquakes. A shallow crustal or
upper mantle earthquake model by Zhao et al (2017) is also included.
